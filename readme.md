# Destinations 

We were taken to three destinations, each day we apent at one location.
## 1. Hell’s Kitchen
A dramatic sandstone canyon with layered colors that change with the light.  
It’s often called “Kenya’s Grand Canyon” and is especially beautiful at sunset.  


## 2. Fort Jesus  
A UNESCO World Heritage site built by the Portuguese in the 16th century.  
The fort played a huge role in the history of the Swahili Coast and is full of history and culture.  


## 3. Gede Ruins  
The remains of an ancient Swahili town hidden in the forest.  
It’s an archaeological site that shows the mix of African, Arab, and Asian influences in coastal Kenya. 

## outcome
This trip gave me a chance  to escape my family it was an exciting and new, oh and i also got to experience Kenya’s coastal heritage from natural wonders to historical landmarks. It was like 3 days but it was nice honestly.
